# Sensorberg Interviewer Embedded Test
Hey Interviewer! This is our repository for a little test to validate your way of working, thinking and problem solving.
You will find a bunch of questions below which you can answer.
Lets start:

## 1. Schematics and Datasheets
Look at the schematic in this repo and answer the following questions. You might need to read a bit in the datasheet of the components.
Everything you will need for this exercise can be found in this repo.

#### 1.1 Which GPIOs do you need to drive HIGH to get the color Pink on the RGB LEDs (D1,D2,D3)?

#### 1.2 Which interface is used to communicate with the GPIO-Expander MCP23017 and what is the Address (in hex) to reach it?

#### 1.3 Under which conditions will LED D4 light up?

#### 1.4 It turns out that touching the PCB somehow makes the LED D4 light up and flicker, why could that be?

## 2. Software
Look at the 'main.py' file and answer the following questions

#### 2.1 Please describe what the code together with the schematic is doing.

#### 2.2 What could make this code better? What would you change?

#### 2.3 From the schematics there are 2 GPIOs used for the OR-Gate C1. Which GPIOs are used and how do you need to initialize them correctly so the LED D4 is turned off? (ignoring the fact that the OR-Gate C2 could turn it on). 

## 3. Concept
You can find a WiKi page containing a User-Story as a task please find it and complete the task.


## To answer the questions you can send an E-Mail. There is no need to interact with this repository.
